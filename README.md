# Toki

Toki is an i18n framework for Go and a Textual Internationalization Key
([**TIK**](https://github.com/romshark/tik))
processor implementation.

`toki generate` parses the source code, lints it reporting any misuse or errors,
extracts localized texts and generates a localization bundle.

[app-resource-bundle (.arb)](https://github.com/google/app-resource-bundle)
files as used as intermediate translation storage,
[TIK](https://github.com/romshark/tik) for text keys and
[ICU messages](https://unicode-org.github.io/icu/userguide/format_parse/messages/).

## Bundle File Structure

- `bundle_gen.go` contains the generated `Bundle` type, helper functions and
  overwritable fallback functions (`MissingTranslationString`, `MissingTranslationWrite`).
  `Bundle` contains all catalogs and implements the `toki.Bundler` interface.
  - **Not editable** ü§ñ Any manual change is always overwritten.
- `catalog_<locale>_gen.go` contains the catalog type for a particular locale
  implementing the `toki.Reader` interface.
  - **Not editable** ü§ñ Any manual change is always overwritten.
- `catalog.<locale>.arb` is an app resource bundle file containing actual translations
  for a particular locale.
  - **Editable üìù**
  - Changed translations are preserved.
  - If a new text isn't found in the translation file it's automatically added.
  - If a text is no longer used in the source code it's removed from this file.
- `head.txt` is a text file defining the head comment to use in generated files.
  - **Editable üìù**
  - If this file isn't found a new blank file is always automatically created.
- `context.txt` is a text file defining the overall global context for translators.
  - **Editable üìù**
  - If this file isn't found a new blank file is always automatically created.

All other files in the bundle package are ignored.
