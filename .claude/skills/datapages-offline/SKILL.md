  The Datapages service worker: offline page snapshots and cached shims
  written by handlers through the pageCache parameter, the offline module
  and its Config, and the PageOffline fallback.
---

# Offline and instant loads

Read `datapages` first for the build loop, hard rules and naming conventions.

`modules/offline` serves a service worker and adds registration to HTML responses. Handlers write its cache through the `pageCache datapages.PageCacheWriter` parameter:

- **Snapshots** (`Set`): served only while the browser is offline.
- **Shims** (`SetShim`): served online too, at once, then replaced by the live page.

The worker runs only in a secure context (HTTPS or localhost). Everywhere else the API does nothing.

## Configure the module

Declaring `PageOffline` generates a `WithOffline` option with that page's route:

```go
// PageOffline is /offline
type PageOffline struct{ App *App }

func (PageOffline) GET(r *http.Request) (body datapages.Component, err error) {
	return pageOffline(), nil
}
```

```go
opts := []datapages.ServerOption{
	// Self-host Datastar: the CDN is unreachable offline.
	datapages.WithDatastarJS(assets.Path("datastar.js")),
	datapagesgen.WithOffline(app.OfflineConfig()),
}
```

```go
// OfflineWorkerVersion identifies the installed worker and its cache. Increment
// it after a Datapages upgrade or a change to Assets, ExcludePaths,
// CrossOriginDestinations, OfflineClass, or PageOffline. Changes to Assets or
// PageOffline require a new installation because the worker fetches them only
// during installation.
const OfflineWorkerVersion = 1

func OfflineConfig() offline.Config {
	return offline.Config{
		WorkerVersion: OfflineWorkerVersion,
		// Precache the files required to render cached pages offline.
		Assets: []string{
			assets.Path("style.css"), assets.Path("datastar.js"),
		},
	}
}
```

For shims without `PageOffline`, install the module directly:

```go
offline.WithServiceWorker("", offline.Config{WorkerVersion: 1})
```

| `offline.Config` field | default |
| ---------------------- | ------- |
| `WorkerVersion` | 1; increment after a Datapages upgrade or a change to `Assets`, `ExcludePaths`, `CrossOriginDestinations`, `OfflineClass`, or `PageOffline` |
| `ScriptURL` | `/service-worker.js`; the scope is the whole origin either way |
| `Assets` | none; files cached during installation |
| `OfflineClass` | `is-offline`, toggled on `<html>` while offline |
| `CrossOriginDestinations` | `image`, `style`, `script`, `font`; empty non-nil disables |
| `ExcludePaths` | none; same-origin prefixes never cached |

Style offline state in CSS, no Go code:

```css
.is-offline [data-needs-network] { opacity: .5; pointer-events: none }
```

Register a compressing middleware before `WithOffline`. Middleware runs in the order it is given, and the offline middleware rewrites the HTML it receives. A response that already carries a `Content-Encoding` passes through unchanged, which leaves the page without the worker registration.

Offline support writes inline scripts: the connectivity script, the worker registration and queued cache writes. Each script uses the nonce from `WithCSPNonce`. `WithOffline` reads the nonce when each request arrives, independent of option order. Set `offline.Config.CSPNonce` to use a different nonce for these scripts.

When `offline.Config.CSPNonce` is nil, `offline.WithServiceWorker` uses the nonce from `WithCSPNonce`. Calling `offline.Middleware` through `datapages.WithMiddleware` does not copy the server nonce. A nonce-only policy blocks the middleware scripts.

A cached page is rendered once and replayed. It cannot contain a valid per-response nonce. Its shim hydration trigger and connectivity script are written without one. The service worker provides no policy header, and the browser does not require a nonce. A `Content-Security-Policy` in a `meta` element would block those scripts.

## PageOffline

`PageOffline` is reserved like `PageError404` and `PageError500`. The worker caches it during installation and returns it for an uncached URL while offline. It renders with a zero `Session`. Datapages supplies a minimal default.

## The pageCache parameter

The parameter is optional on `GET` methods and on page or `*App` actions.

| method | effect |
| ------ | ------ |
| `Version()` | the version the client holds for **this request's URL**, 0 if none |
| `Set(url, body, version)` | cache `body` for `url`, served only while offline |
| `SetShim(url, body, version)` | cache `body` for `url`, served online too |
| `Clear(url)` | remove one entry |
| `ClearAll()` | remove every page cache entry |

`url` comes from the generated `href` package. Writes remain queued until the handler returns without error. The worker then applies them together, with `ClearAll` first.

`Version()` covers this URL only. Caching any other URL is therefore unconditional.

## Snapshots

```go
func (p PagePost) GET(
	r *http.Request,
	pageCache datapages.PageCacheWriter,
	path datapages.Path[struct {
		Slug string `path:"slug"`
	}],
) (body datapages.Component, err error) {
	post, ok := p.App.Post(path.Values.Slug)
	if !ok {
		return nil, datapages.ErrNotFound
	}
	if ver := postVersion(post); pageCache.Version() != ver {
		pageCache.Set(href.PagePost(post.Slug), postOffline(post), ver)
	}
	return postPage(post), nil
}
```

A snapshot need not match the live body. It is what the user sees with no network: leave out what cannot work there.

A `GET` can cache its own page when visited. An action can cache other URLs, such as ticket pages created by a purchase.

## Shims

A shim renders the navigation and layout with placeholders for slow content. The worker returns the cached shim immediately and fetches the live page in parallel. Datapages adds the trigger that replaces the shim's head and body through Datastar. The shim contains no Datastar attributes.

A shim renders with no session and contains no CSRF script. Do not put actions in the placeholder content.

```go
// shimVersion changes when the placeholder markup changes.
const shimVersion = 1

func (p PageIndex) GET(
	r *http.Request, pageCache datapages.PageCacheWriter,
) (body datapages.Component, err error) {
	rows, err := p.App.Rows(r.Context())
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	if pageCache.Version() != shimVersion {
		pageCache.SetShim(href.PageIndex(), shim(len(rows)), shimVersion)
	}
	return indexPage(rows), nil
}
```

A shim is also shown online. It must not make an offline-only claim. If the live request fails, the shim remains visible.

## Rules

- **Pass the page body, not a document.** Datapages adds the same `<head>`, stylesheets and Datastar bundle used by a live page. Adding `<!DOCTYPE html>` to the body would nest one document inside another.
- **A cached page is only as complete as its assets.** Its stylesheets, scripts, fonts and images must be cached too. `Config.Assets` is precached on install. Everything else is cached on its first load while online: same-origin files other than what Datastar requests (actions, hydrates and event streams always come from the network) and other than `Config.ExcludePaths`, plus cross-origin requests whose destination is in `Config.CrossOriginDestinations`. An asset that is neither listed nor ever loaded online is missing offline. A cached same-origin asset is refreshed behind the copy it serves: a file redeployed at the same URL lands on the next visit, with no `WorkerVersion` bump.
- **Version by everything the body depends on.** A constant version caches once and never refreshes. Include the content state, such as an item count or an ownership flag.

  ```go
  // The ownership button changes, so ownership is part of the version.
  ver := snapshotVersion(session.UserID, owned) // For example, an FNV-1a hash.
  if pageCache.Version() != ver {
    pageCache.Set(href.PagePost(slug), postOffline(post), ver)
  }
  ```
- **Use `!=`, not `<`, for an unordered version key** such as a hash. `<` re-caches only on an increase and silently keeps a stale entry.
- **Use `ClearAll()` when one change invalidates many pages.** Examples include locale, permission and session changes. Entries return only after a handler calls `Set` again. Call `ClearAll()` during sign-in and sign-out.
- **Update invalidated entries.** A page cached by its `GET` updates on the next online visit. An action that changes another cached page should call `Set` for that page.

## What may be cached

A snapshot is stored in the browser's cache for the origin. Any script on that origin can read it. It is not bound to a session and stays readable after the visitor signs out.

- Call `ClearAll()` from the sign-in and sign-out handlers. Only `Clear` and `ClearAll` remove an entry.
- A redirect waits up to 500ms for the worker. A tab closed before that keeps its old entries.
- Leave out what must not outlive the session: a payment detail, a token, another person's data. Cache the page without it.
- A snapshot renders with the zero session. A template that branches on the session takes the signed-out branch. Put the visitor in the version key when a snapshot has to differ per visitor.

## Delivery

The generated code picks how queued writes reach the worker from the handler signature, first row that matches. An action on `*App` follows the same rules as one on a page.

| handler | delivery |
| ------- | -------- |
| `GET` | embedded in the page HTML and applied on load |
| action taking `sse` | sent over that stream |
| action returning `redirect` | sent in its `text/javascript` response; navigation waits up to 500ms for the worker. This applies even when the action also returns a body |
| action returning only a body | embedded in the rendered document |
| action returning neither | sent over an SSE stream opened for that purpose, readable only by a Datastar request |

`newSession` and `closeSession` cannot be combined with `sse`. Sign-in and sign-out therefore take `pageCache` and return a `redirect`. Navigation waits up to 500ms for the worker to apply `ClearAll` before loading the destination.
