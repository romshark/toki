# Datapages

Write Go handlers and Templ templates. `datapages gen` generates routing, handler registration, SSE and session code. It also generates the type-safe `href` and `action` packages.

Read `datapages-architecture` first when starting an app or designing a new feature. It explains how to select the required Datapages constructs. Then read the task-specific skills below.

## Loop

Write the app model first, then generate its helpers before templates call them:

```sh
datapages gen
templ generate # after any .templ change, and never while datapages watch runs
datapages lint
go build ./...
```

`datapages gen` reports parse errors and suggested fixes on stderr. Fix the app package and run it again. It also runs `go mod tidy`. A tidy failure makes the command fail even when code generation succeeded. `datapages lint` performs the checks without generating files.

An earlier `templ generate` can produce references to helpers that do not exist yet. Remove those references, run `templ generate`, then run `datapages gen`. Restore the references and run `templ generate` again. After an initial parse failure, the generator may write empty stub helper packages.

Use Templ `v0.3.1020`, which the generated CI workflow pins. Use `datapages watch` as the local development server.

### Never run `templ generate` while `datapages watch` runs

Running `templ generate` interrupts the development server. `datapages watch` runs templ in watch mode, which reads application template strings from files in the temporary directory. A separate `templ generate` deletes those files when it exits. The server cannot render again until the next `.templ` change recreates them.

Check before generating. `datapages watch` keeps one lock file per module fresh in the `datapages-watch` directory under the system temporary directory (`$TMPDIR` on macOS, `/tmp` on Linux, `%TEMP%` on Windows). A `.lock` file written less than 10 seconds ago means a watch is running. The file contains its PID, module directory, and development server host:

```sh
ls -lt "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/datapages-watch" # inspect lock modification times
pgrep -f "datapages watch"               # POSIX process check
```

The watcher regenerates changed files. Wait for it. To generate manually, stop the watcher first and restart it afterward.

The restriction also applies to commands that invoke `templ generate`, including wrapper targets in `make` or Mage.

To restore rendering, save a `.templ` file or restart the watcher.

## Rules

- Never edit a `_gen.go` file, anything under `datapagesgen/`, or a file with a `DO NOT EDIT` header. Change the source and regenerate.
- Never hardcode an app-internal URL. `href.PageX()` for links, `action.PageX.Y.POST()` for page actions and `action.App.Y.POST()` for app actions.
- Never write JavaScript for application logic. Logic is Go on the server, the client is Datastar attributes. JS only for browser APIs Datastar cannot reach, such as the clipboard.
- Never open an SSE stream, set a CSRF header, add the Datastar script or register a service worker by hand. Datapages does all four.
- Submit `<form>` elements through Datastar actions. Browser form submissions do not carry the CSRF token; see `datapages-templates`.
- Do not put build-constrained files in the app package. The generator reads its pages, actions and events for the host platform, so a platform-specific declaration can disappear from generated code elsewhere.
- Prefer one HTML fragment that carries its own context over many small patches or over signal updates. The server is the source of truth, signals hold transient client state.

## Security

Datapages routes the request, hands the handler its session and escapes what Templ and the `href`, `action` and subject helpers write. The rest is on the application code:

- **Authorization.** The session says who the visitor is, never what they may see or do. Return `datapages.ErrForbidden` for authorization errors, wrapped or bare. The error message is logged.
- **Values in Datastar attributes.** The browser decodes the HTML escaping before the expression is parsed. Encode with `json.Marshal`, never with `fmt.Sprintf("'%s'", v)`. See `datapages-templates`.
- **`templ.Raw`.** Writes markup verbatim. Pass only markup the server built.
- **Hand-built URLs and subjects.** `href.PageX()` and a `datapages.Subject` field escape their values. A string you concatenate does not.
- **Offline snapshots.** `pageCache.Set` stores a page body in the browser's cache. It survives a sign-out until a handler clears it. Call `ClearAll()` on sign-in and sign-out. See `datapages-offline`.

A value Templ interpolates into text or into an attribute is already escaped. Escaping it again shows the escape sequence to the visitor.

`SECURITY.md` in the Datapages repository carries the full list, including what belongs to the deployment.

## Naming

The parser reads names and doc comments. Both decide behaviour.

| kind | name | doc comment |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| page | `Page` + uppercase + alnum | `// PageX is /route` |
| action | `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` + uppercase + alnum | `// POSTX is /route` |
| event | `Event` + uppercase + alnum | `// EventX is "subject.name"` |
| event handler | `On` + the event name after `Event`: `OnFoo` for `EventFoo` | none |
| stream hook | `StreamOpen`, `StreamClose` | none |
| assets | any `embed.FS` variable | `// StaticFS is /static/` |

Do not use underscores or a lowercase letter after the prefix. The word `is` is required. Quote event subjects but not routes. If a route comment has more text, add a blank `//` line after its first line.

`PageIndex`, the page for `/`, is required. A page struct declares `App *App` and no other named field. It may also embed types. Page methods use value receivers. App methods such as `Head`, `RecoverError` and app actions use `*App`.

The generator matches handler parameters and return values by type, not by position. Parameter names are unrestricted except for `stateID`. Declare only the values that the handler needs.

## Testing

The generated server implements `http.Handler`. Test it by sending requests with `httptest`. Set `Datastar-Request: true` for a Datastar action. For a stateful tab, copy the `Datapages-Instance` value from the page response to its action and stream requests. Assert the HTTP status and returned HTML or SSE events. A successful `go build ./...` alone does not test request behavior.
