# AGENTS.md

This module is a [Datapages](https://github.com/romshark/datapages) application. You write Go handlers and Templ templates. `datapages gen` writes the server.

Before writing code for a new app or a feature that has no constructs yet, read `.agents/skills/datapages-architecture/SKILL.md`. It decides where a value lives, how a change reaches the browser and who owns a handler. The other skills say how to write what it picks.

| path | what |
| ---- | ---- |
| `editor/app/` | app package: pages, actions, events, templates. Edit this. |
| `editor/app/datapagesgen/` | generated. Never edit. |
| `cmd/editor-server/` | server entry point. Generated once, then yours. |
| `datapages.yaml` | CLI and dev server settings. |

Build loop: write the app model, run `datapages gen` to generate helpers, then `templ generate` after a `.templ` change, `datapages lint` and `go build ./...`. `datapages gen` also runs `go mod tidy`.

Hard rules:

- Never edit a `_gen.go` file, anything under `datapagesgen/`, or a file with a `DO NOT EDIT` header. Change the source and regenerate.
- Never hardcode an app-internal URL. Use the generated `href` package for links and the generated `action` package for Datastar actions.
- Never write JavaScript for application logic, open an SSE stream by hand, set a CSRF header, add the Datastar script or register a service worker.
- Submit forms through generated Datastar actions. Browser form submissions do not carry the CSRF token.

Task instructions are in `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Read the one that matches the task:

| skill | read it when |
| ----- | ------------ |
| `datapages-architecture` | a new app, or a feature whose constructs are not decided |
| `datapages` | any Datapages work: rules, workflow, naming |
| `datapages-pages` | pages, routes, path and query parameters, error pages, `<head>` |
| `datapages-actions` | POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE handlers, signals, SSE, errors |
| `datapages-events` | events, subjects, dispatchers, `On` handlers, stream hooks |
| `datapages-state` | per-tab server state and state-scoped events |
| `datapages-sessions` | authentication, session data, CSRF |
| `datapages-offline` | offline pages, cached shims, the service worker |
| `datapages-server` | server entry points, options, broker, static assets |
| `datapages-templates` | `.templ` files, `href` and `action` helpers, Templ pitfalls |
| `datastar` | `data-*` attributes and `@get`/`@post` actions |
